# Custom Keyboard Shortcuts Example
# This example shows alternative bindings for different workflows
# Copy relevant sections to ~/.config/corgiterm/config.toml

# ============================================================================
# Example 1: Vim-style Navigation
# ============================================================================
[keybindings.shortcuts]
# Use Vim-like keys for pane navigation
focus_next_pane = "Ctrl+W+L"      # Like Vim's window right
focus_prev_pane = "Ctrl+W+H"      # Like Vim's window left
split_horizontal = "Ctrl+W+V"      # Vertical split (Vim convention)
split_vertical = "Ctrl+W+S"        # Horizontal split (Vim convention)
close_pane = "Ctrl+W+Q"            # Quit window

# ============================================================================
# Example 2: Emacs-style Bindings
# ============================================================================
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# new_tab = "Ctrl+X+T"
# close_tab = "Ctrl+X+K"
# next_tab = "Ctrl+X+Right"
# prev_tab = "Ctrl+X+Left"
# split_horizontal = "Ctrl+X+3"
# split_vertical = "Ctrl+X+2"
# close_pane = "Ctrl+X+0"
# focus_next_pane = "Ctrl+X+O"
# quit = "Ctrl+X+Ctrl+C"

# ============================================================================
# Example 3: macOS-style (Cmd key instead of Ctrl)
# ============================================================================
# Note: Use "Super" for the Windows/Command key
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# new_tab = "Super+T"
# close_tab = "Super+W"
# next_tab = "Super+Shift+]"
# prev_tab = "Super+Shift+["
# new_document_tab = "Super+N"
# open_file = "Super+O"
# quick_switcher = "Super+K"
# toggle_ai = "Super+Shift+A"
# ssh_manager = "Super+Shift+S"
# quit = "Super+Q"

# ============================================================================
# Example 4: Tmux-style Bindings
# ============================================================================
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# # Use Ctrl+B as prefix (simulate with single combos)
# split_horizontal = "Ctrl+B+%"      # Would need sequence support
# split_vertical = "Ctrl+B+\""       # Would need sequence support
# close_pane = "Ctrl+B+X"            # Would need sequence support
# new_tab = "Ctrl+B+C"               # Would need sequence support
# next_tab = "Ctrl+B+N"              # Would need sequence support
# prev_tab = "Ctrl+B+P"              # Would need sequence support
# Note: Multi-key sequences not yet supported, these won't work as-is

# ============================================================================
# Example 5: Windows/Linux Desktop Standard
# ============================================================================
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# new_tab = "Ctrl+T"
# close_tab = "Ctrl+W"
# new_document_tab = "Ctrl+N"
# open_file = "Ctrl+O"
# quit = "Alt+F4"
# next_tab = "Ctrl+PageDown"
# prev_tab = "Ctrl+PageUp"
# switch_to_tab_1 = "Alt+1"
# switch_to_tab_2 = "Alt+2"
# switch_to_tab_3 = "Alt+3"
# switch_to_tab_4 = "Alt+4"
# switch_to_tab_5 = "Alt+5"
# switch_to_tab_6 = "Alt+6"
# switch_to_tab_7 = "Alt+7"
# switch_to_tab_8 = "Alt+8"
# switch_to_tab_9 = "Alt+9"

# ============================================================================
# Example 6: Minimal Shortcuts (disable what you don't use)
# ============================================================================
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# # Keep only essential shortcuts
# new_tab = "Ctrl+T"
# close_tab = "Ctrl+W"
# quit = "Ctrl+Q"
#
# # Disable everything else
# quick_switcher = ""
# ssh_manager = ""
# toggle_ai = ""
# split_horizontal = ""
# split_vertical = ""
# close_pane = ""
# new_document_tab = ""
# open_file = ""

# ============================================================================
# Example 7: Function Key Workflow
# ============================================================================
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# new_tab = "F1"
# close_tab = "F2"
# next_tab = "F3"
# prev_tab = "F4"
# split_horizontal = "F5"
# split_vertical = "F6"
# toggle_ai = "F9"
# quick_switcher = "F10"
# ssh_manager = "F11"
# quit = "F12"

# ============================================================================
# Example 8: Left-hand Only (for mouse users)
# ============================================================================
# [keybindings.shortcuts]
# # All shortcuts accessible with left hand only
# new_tab = "Ctrl+T"
# close_tab = "Ctrl+W"
# next_tab = "Ctrl+E"               # E for "next"
# prev_tab = "Ctrl+Q"               # Q for "previous"
# split_horizontal = "Ctrl+R"       # R for "split right"
# split_vertical = "Ctrl+D"         # D for "split down"
# close_pane = "Ctrl+X"             # X for "close"
# quick_switcher = "Ctrl+Space"
# toggle_ai = "Ctrl+A"

# Tips for Creating Custom Shortcuts
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Avoid conflicts with terminal programs:
#    - Don't use Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+D (shell controls)
#    - Be careful with Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E (readline/emacs bindings)
#
# 2. Consider muscle memory:
#    - If you use other terminals, match their shortcuts
#    - Keep frequently used actions on easy-to-reach keys
#
# 3. Use logical groupings:
#    - Group related actions (all tab actions together)
#    - Use similar modifiers for similar types of actions
#
# 4. Test before committing:
#    - Try shortcuts in practice before finalizing
#    - Make sure they don't conflict with apps you use
#
# 5. Document your custom setup:
#    - Add comments explaining your choices
#    - Keep a backup of your config
